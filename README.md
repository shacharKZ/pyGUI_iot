# Try it yourself
in order to run the simple demo (application with only local files) just install the requirements (requirements.txt) and run data_entry.py

# Connect to your firebase
in order to use firebase you will need to add your own firebase data. go to fire_base.py and fill your details next to the TODO we left in the code
